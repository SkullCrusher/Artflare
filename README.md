# Artflare
Artflare is a group drawing game inspired by the party game [`Jackbox`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/434170/The_Jackbox_Party_Pack_3)

Each player draws some art and writes some captions for the art at random. Then they are shuffled and given to players at random and players use what they are given to try to make the most funny combination. The winner is voted on by everyone based on what they thought as the most funny.

## Original what it's based on

## Getting started
To run this you just have to yarn install and deploy the wrangler model.

## Installing
```console
yarn install
wrangler publish --new-class ArtRoom --new-class RateLimiter
```

## Why was this made?
I built this for fun to enter the 2021 Cloudflare summer developer challenge and hopefully get some swag. I had very little time to build this so it's super rough, it's just prototype to show a concept.
